                <p>
                    Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference.
                    The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object.
                    Incidentally, "boid" is also a New York Metropolitan dialect pronunciation for "bird.
                    Rules applied in simple Boids
                    Separation,
                    Alignment,
                    Cohesion,
                    As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents 
                    (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:
                    separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
                    alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
                    cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

                <p class="h2">QuadTree Algorithm</p>
                <p>Quadtrees are trees used to efficiently store data of points on a two-dimensional space. In this tree, each node has at most four children.
                    We can construct a quadtree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
                    Divide the current two dimensional space into four boxes.
                    If a box contains one or more points in it, create a child object, storing in it the two dimensional space of the box
                    If a box does not contain any points, do not create a child for it
                    Recurse for each of the children.
                    Quadtrees are used in image compression, where each node contains the average colour of each of its children. The deeper you traverse in the tree, the more the detail of the image.
                    Quadtrees are also used in searching for nodes in a two-dimensional area. For instance, if you wanted to find the closest point to given coordinates, you can do it using quadtrees.

                    Ken Perlin developed perlin noise in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the "machine-like" look of computer-generated imagery (CGI) at the time.
                    [1] He formally described his findings in a SIGGRAPH paper in 1985 called An image Synthesizer.[2] He developed it at Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. (MAGI) for Disney's computer animated sci-fi motion picture Tron (1982). 
                    In 1997, Perlin was awarded an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for creating the algorithm.[3][4] [5][6]
                    To Ken Perlin for the development of Perlin Noise, a technique used to produce natural appearing textures on computer generated surfaces for motion picture visual effects. 
                    The development of Perlin Noise has allowed computer graphics artists to better represent the complexity of natural phenomena in visual effects for the motion picture industry.

            <h3>Credit Risk Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                The loan is one of the most important products of banking. All the banks are trying to figure out effective business strategies to persuade customers to
                apply their loans. However, there are some customers who behave negatively after their applications are approved. To prevent this situation, banks have 
                to find some methods to predict customers’ behaviours. Machine learning algorithms have a pretty good performance on this purpose, which are widely-used by 
                the banking industry. Here, I work on loan behaviours prediction using machine learning models.

                I have worked on a pid controller using arduino 
                A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a 
                variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value {\displaystyle e(t)}e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and 
                a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.
